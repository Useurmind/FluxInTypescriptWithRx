This is the documentation for the RFluXX core library.

The core library provides the basic building blocks of the framework. These include:

* Actions
* Stores
* Middleware
* Container

The core library aims at being reusable in different contexts even when not using react.

Therefore, you should not see any react specific logic in it (not completely true yet, but I will aim for it ;) )
