# Rfluxx Forms

The motivation behind rfluxx forms is to bring together the rfluxx store system with react components and make creating forms easy and fun.

## One form, one model

The core idea of rfluxx forms is to have one object per form that holds all the data shown in the form.

This includes atomic fields like text, booleans, numbers or dates. But it also means subjects and collections of subobjects or assigned objects.

## Planned features

Based on this concept the following features are planned for implementation:

- validation
- change/version tracking
- save status indication
- error handling
- saving the complete object
- saving single fields or assignments of the compete object
- auto saving while editing
