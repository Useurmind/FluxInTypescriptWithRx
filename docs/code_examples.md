# Code examples

There are code examples for both rfluxx alone and the rfluxx-routing library in the git repository.

If you have problems seeing how to put together an app from all the code snippets in the docs, try to have a look at the examples.

- [rfluxx examples](https://github.com/Useurmind/RFluXX/tree/master/packages/rfluxx/example)
- [rfluxx-routing examples](https://github.com/Useurmind/RFluXX/tree/master/packages/rfluxx-example/src)

Also the yeoman generator for rfluxx can generate a ready made project. See the [tutorial](tutorial.md) for usage instructions.
