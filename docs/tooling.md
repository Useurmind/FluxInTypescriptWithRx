# Tooling

We provide several tools to help develope with the rfluxx framework.

## Visual Studio Code Snippets

There is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with snippets that make setup of different rfluxx components easier.

To install it go into the extension menu of VS code and search for 'rfluxx'. Install the extension and you are ready to go.

All snippets start with the prefix `rfluxx_`. 

**Note**: different snippets are available for `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

## Yeoman generator

To setup an rfluxx project we provide a [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator.

To install it:

    npm i -g yo generator-rfluxx

To run it create a new folder for your project and execute the following command in it:

    yo rfluxx

After this you will have a rfluxx app ready to run, develop and test.
